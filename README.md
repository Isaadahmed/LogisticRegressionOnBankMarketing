# LogisticRegressionOnBankMarketing
Developing a logistic regression model for a bank using the Python programming language in order to determine whether or not a customer has subscribed to a particular plan.

Simple Logistic Regression is implemented on Bank Marketing dataset using scikit-learn

## Problem Statement
These numbers are associated with direct marketing efforts carried out by a Portuguese financial institution. The phone calls served as the foundation for the marketing campaigns. It was often necessary to make multiple contacts with the same customer in order to determine whether or not the product in question (a bank term deposit) would be subscribed to ('yes') or not ('no'). As part of this assignment, you will need to construct a model that can determine whether or not an advertising campaign will be successful in convincing a customer to open a term deposit account.
